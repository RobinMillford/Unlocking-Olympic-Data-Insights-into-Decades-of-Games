"Unlocking Olympic Data Insights: Decades of Games"

In this project, I delved into Olympic data using SQL queries, offering a comprehensive understanding of Olympic history. Here's a summary of the operations performed:

1. **Data Preprocessing:** I initiated the project by cleaning and preprocessing two datasets, 'dataset_olympics.csv' and 'noc_region.csv.' This involved data cleaning, column selection, handling missing values, and saving the cleaned datasets as new CSV files.

2. **SQL Queries:** Leveraging SQL, I tackled a series of questions and challenges related to Olympic data:

   - I queried the total count of Olympic games held throughout history.
   - I compiled a chronological list of all Olympic games, sorted by year.
   - I calculated the number of participating nations in each Olympic game, sorted by games.
   - I identified the nation that consistently participated in every Olympic game, sorted by the earliest appearance.
   - I determined the count of unique athletes who achieved gold medals in the Olympics.
   - I listed sports that were featured only once in the Olympics, ordered by the sport name.
   - I unearthed the oldest athlete to have won a gold medal in Olympic history.
   - I pinpointed the top athletes with the most gold medals in the Olympics, ordered by gold medals in descending order.
   - I found the total number of sports played in each Olympic game, sorted by the number of sports in descending order.
   - I unveiled the top athletes with the most medals (gold/silver/bronze) in the Olympics, ordered by total medals in descending order.
   - Lastly, I highlighted all Olympic games where India secured medals in Hockey, listing the number of medals won in each game, and ordering the results by the medal count in descending order.

**Data Visualization in Power BI:** Additionally, I complemented the SQL analysis with data visualization in Power BI By harnessing the power of visual storytelling, I presented key insights from the Olympic data, making it more accessible and engaging for stakeholders and enthusiasts. These visuals provided a dynamic and interactive way to explore and understand the data.

This project aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of Olympic data, offering insights into participation, medalists, athletes' achievements, and the rich history of the Olympic Games. The SQL queries and Power BI visualizations together served as a valuable resource for data exploration and learning.
